# AlphaGear 2

Anything you need to manage your skills and gear.
I've adopted this great AddOn from AlphaLemming and changed the name to "AlphaGear 2" for the version that I maintain.

AlphaGear 2 lets you create up to 20 profiles each with 16 builds that may be activated with a single button press. Each build consists of

* 7 pieces of armor
* 3 pieces of jewelry
* 2 weapon bars including poison
* 2 skill bars
* 1 outfit or
* 1 style (outfit, costume, pet etc. using AlphaStyle integration) (optional)
* 1 FCO Item Saver gear icon (optional)
* 1 Champion Point Set using Champion Points Slots add-on (optional)

# Now available: Integrations!
* Champion Points Slots - Manage your Champion Point Settings
* AlphaStyle - Manage your Style
* FCO Itemsaver - Manage your Inventory

# Breaking Changes
* If you use poison, you'd have to reassign the right type of poison from your bag.
